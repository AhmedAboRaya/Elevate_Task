## Notes
While I could have used APIs to handle delete, update, and search operations, I opted to manage data with local state. This choice allows for a more realistic user experience, as using APIs would result in dummy data that lacks authenticity in the add, delete, and other functionalities.

This project is designed to be simple and user-friendly, focusing on the user interface and user experience.
